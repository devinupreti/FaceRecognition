# FaceRecognition
Contains code for Face Recognition Project

## Objective
The project aims to create a smart system capable of autonomously detecting and recognizing faces. It also aims to utilize face detection and recognition for real life application.

## Introduction
The current measures adopted for taking classroom attendance are often based on roll call. This method is unreliable as any student can mark their friend’s attendance on a false call. There are other systems also that use ID cards for attendance but these are also prone to fake attendance. A person can mark any other person’s attendance by just having their card. Also, such systems often take a lot of time to obtain the attendance of full classroom. Hence, there is a need for a better attendance system which is efficient, reliable, less time consuming and not prone to false attendance.

Face Detection and Recognition are used in various applications from security to automation. Although, Face Detection and Recognition are trivial tasks for humans but they are not so simple to perform for a computer. Detection of a face is a much simpler and easier task than Recognition of a face. Face Detection requires the identification of the area of the provided image that contains a face whereas Face Recognition requires the classification of the area of image that contains a face to a specific person. This system uses the technology of Facial Detection and Recognition to build an automated attendance system which is capable of recognizing students present in an image and subsequently use this information to mark the class attendance. An automated attendance system can serve to decrease the wastage of time during classes by automating the attendance routine. The system can be modified to serve other applications such as security and object tracking.

## Dependencies  
OS, Numpy, Pillow, OpenCV, Tkinter and Flask.
